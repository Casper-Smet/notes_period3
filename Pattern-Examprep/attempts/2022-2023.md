1.    
    a. 0.47515 **WRONG: misread the question, but makes sense. Should be 0.5 as moore's law say we double each two years**
    b. (-925.49861 + 0.47515 * 1995) = 22.42564
        log2(t_n) = 22.42564
        t_n = 2^22.42564 = 5633656   **CORRECT**
    c. **NOTE** pr(>|t|)?? **WRONG: Should be R-Squared expressed as a percentage. (Multiple) R-squared shows variation explained by regression.**
2. 
    a. Yes, they are consistent. The coefficients are both negative, meaning that the greater the complexity and variation, the smaller the value resulting from the regression, the closer to t=0. t=0 when human generated text, so it lines up.   **CORRECT**
    b. 4.363 + -5.310 * 0.5 + -3.056 * 0.5 = 0.18   **PARTIAL. After regression, requires probability calculation. I.e. exp(z)/(1+exp(z)) where z=0.18, exp(x) = e^x**
    c. t = {1 if 4.363 + -5.310 * complexity + -3.056 * variation > 0.5
            0 otherwise}  **WRONG, but good spirit lol. Should be > 0 instead**
    d. I think no, because Pr(>|z|) > alpha **Correct. Pr(>|z|) implies significance**
3. i don't get svm's at all yet lmao
    a. **WRONG: support vectors are all vectors where a_n != 0?**
