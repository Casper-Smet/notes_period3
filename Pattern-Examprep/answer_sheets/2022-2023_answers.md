Question 1

(a) b = 0.5

    t = 2^(a+b*x)
    If we increase x by 2 we get t'=2^(a+b*(x+2)) = 2^(a+b*x+2*b) = 2^(a+b*x)*2^(2*b) = t * 2^(2*b).
    If we pick b=0.5, then t' is double the value of t.

(b) log2(t) = -925.49861 + 0.47515 * 1995 = 22.42564
    t = 2^22.42564 = 5,633,656
(c) Approximately 97% (R-squared = 0.9706)

Question 2

(a) Yes. The coefficient of complexity is negative. Hence, the higher the value of complexity,
    the less likely it is that the text was written by Chat GPT (t=1), and therefore, the more
    likely it is that it was written by a human (t=0). This is consistent with
    "We expect that if the text has high complexity then it's more likely to be human-written rather than AI-generated".
    A similar argument applies to the coefficient of variation.

(b) z = 4.363 - 0.5 * 5.310 - 0.5 * 3.056 = 0.18
    exp(z)/(1+exp(z)) = exp(0.18)/(1+exp(0.18)) = 0.545

(c) If 4.363 - 5.31*complexity - 3.056*variation > 0 then predict Chat GTP, otherwise predict human.
    Or (more intuitive): if 5.31*complexity + 3.056*variation < 4.363 then Chat GPT, otherwise human.
    Of course, the strict inequality may be replaced by a non-strict one.

    Some students just wrote down the linear inequality without saying which class is predicted when.
    That is not a classification rule!

(d) Complexity is significant, as its p-value is 0.00163 which is smaller than alpha = 0.01.
    Variation is not significant, as its p-value is 0.01801, which is larger than alpha = 0.01.

Question 3

(a) n = 1,4,5

(b) y(x1,x2) = 5/3 - 4/3*x1 + 2/3*x2 = 0

    It is essential that you equate to zero!

(c) w^Tw = -6/5*-6/5 + 3/5*3/5 = 9/5 = 1.8
    The only point with non-zero slack is n=5: y5 = 1.6 - 3*1.2 + 2*0.6 = -0.8
    s5 = |-0.8 + 1| = 0.2
    With C=1, the value of the objective function is: 1 * 0.2 + 0.5 * 1.8 = 0.2 + 0.9 = 1.1

    Quite some students argued that the slack is zero for all data points, since they are all classified correctly.
    But the slack is positive for all points on the wrong side of the margin boundary, even if they are classified correctly
    (the slack will be less than one in that case).
